# caplog

I am the captain. This is my log.

My computer's OS has logging, why don't I?

`caplog` is a command-line script that I use to write one-line logs about anything I think is worth logging.
The script adds them to a text file with a timestamp.

`caplog` is compatible with both `python2` and `python3`.

Example log file:

```text
1462166256,Fixed the variance problem in simple-statistics. Feels great to write code and work on this again.
1462209509,Its time to move caplog to a place where I can use it everywhere.
1462209520,And I just pushed a change to simple-statistics. Wanna keep going.
```

Create an alias to make things easier.

```bash
alias caplog='python3 /path/to/caplog.py'
```

Make a new log entry.

```bash
$ caplog Made progress on my caplog script.
```

If used without arguments, `caplog` shows the last three entries in the log.

```text
$ caplog
